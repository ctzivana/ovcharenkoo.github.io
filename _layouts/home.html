    I am a PhD Candidate with entrepreneural mindset at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">King Abdullah University
      of Science and Technology</a> (KAUST) in <a href="https://smi.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx">Seismic Modeling and
      Inversion group</a> run by Prof. <a href="http://danielpeter.github.io/index.html">Daniel Peter</a>. I am broadly
    interested in <b>numerical methods in global and exploration geophysics</b>, which includes but not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li> Seismic Imaging </li>
      <li> Machine Learning </li>
      <li> Natural stress state reconstruction </li>
      <li> HPC </li>
    </ul>
    My PhD research is focused on applying ML techniques to geophysical problems.

  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I grew up in Moscow and received my M.Sc degree in Earth Science from <a href="https://www.msu.ru/en/">Lomonosov
      Moscow State University</a> in 2014. During the M.Sc program my research was focused on natural stress-state
    reconstruction. I was working under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu_Rebetsky">Yu.L.
      Rebetsky</a> in the tectonophysics lab at the <a href="http://www.ifz.ru/en/institute/">Schmidt Institute of
      Physics of the Earth of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

  <p>
    In 2015 I got <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr/international-master-of-research-in-exploration-geophysics-gpx">International
      Master of Research in Exploration Geophysics (GPX)</a> degree from the <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr">Institut
      de Physique du Globe de Paris</a> (IPGP, Paris VII) in Paris. There, I worked with Prof. <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/en/fuji-nobuaki">Nobuaki
      Fuji</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland_Martin/info">Roland Martin</a> (CNRS) on
    accurate finite difference operators for synthetic seismogram calculation in areas with sharp lithological
    interfaces.
